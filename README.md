Hi! I am Tomas Glavina, and I am a Software Engineering student in TAMK Finland. 
I love coding and learning everyday different stuff. As for my studies are quite taking me a lot of my time, I don't have much time for projects
But I continue to work on my skills and slowly uploading some stuff to show my progress.

Last project: Hotel App (CLI) on C++.
